# Terminal Copilot Explain Helper

*A dumb experimental github copilot cli wrapper*

Ever wish you could ask GitHub Copilot to explain what you just did in your terminal, but with as little sophistication as possible? Meet `github-copilot-cli-wrapper`: a gloriously simple, slightly hacky, and very experimental set of shell functions that let you throw your last terminal line (or a few) at Copilot CLI and see what it thinks. 

It grabs your terminal buffer, cleans it up (sort of), and asks Copilot to explain or suggest improvementsâ€”because sometimes you just want answers, and you want them now, even if the method is a bit... dumb. Apple Terminal only, clipboard shenanigans included. Use at your own risk (and amusement)!

## Features

- **`??`**: Explains your last (or Nth last) terminal line(s) using GitHub Copilot CLI.
- **`?!`**: Suggests improvements or alternatives for a given line or lines using Copilot CLI.

## Requirements

- **macOS** (with Apple Terminal)
- [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/)
- [GitHub Copilot CLI extension](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/set-up/installing-github-copilot-in-the-cli)
- Bash or Zsh shell

## Installation

1. **Clone or copy this repo to your machine.**
2. **Install the GitHub CLI and Copilot extension:**
   ```sh
   brew install gh
   gh extension install github/gh-copilot
   ```
3. **Source the script in your shell:**
   ```sh
   source /path/to/custom/github-copilot-cli-wrapper.sh
   ```
   Or add this line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` for automatic loading.

## Usage

| Command                        | Description                                      |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `??`                           | Explain the most recent terminal line             |
| `?? 3`                         | Explain the last 3 terminal lines                 |
| `?? "ls -la /tmp"`             | Explain the given command or text                 |
| `?!`                           | Suggest for the most recent terminal line         |
| `?! 3`                         | Suggest for the last 3 terminal lines             |
| `?! "find . -name '*.tmp'"`    | Suggest for a given command or text               |

**Note:** The number argument to `??` or `?!` refers to lines, not necessarily full shell commands. This means multi-line commands or outputs are treated as separate lines.

## How it Works

- Captures your terminal buffer using AppleScript (for Apple Terminal).
- Cleans up the output, removing empty lines and fixing line endings.
- Extracts the last (or Nth last) line(s) and sends them to `gh copilot explain` or `gh copilot suggest`.

## Configuration

- **Debug mode:**  
  Set `DEBUG=1` at the top of `github-copilot-cli-wrapper.sh` to keep temp files for debugging.  
  Set `DEBUG=0` to auto-delete them after use.

## Limitations

- Only supports Apple Terminal out of the box.
- Requires clipboard access for AppleScript.

## File Overview

- `github-copilot-cli-wrapper.sh`: Main script with `??` and `?!` functions.
- `copy-apple-terminal.sh`: Helper script to copy Apple Terminal buffer to a file.
